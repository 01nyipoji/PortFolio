                                     <br>
                As a follower of Christ, my faith plays a central role in my life and influences my values and interactions with others.
               <br>
               Professionally, I specialize in frontend development, creating engaging and user-friendly interfaces for websites and applications. I enjoy the process of transforming designs into functional and visually appealing user experiences. With a keen eye for detail and a strong understanding of user-centered design principles, I strive to create seamless and intuitive interfaces that enhance the overall user experience.
               <br>
               In addition to my work in frontend development, I am also pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering. This field allows me to delve into the fascinating world of engineering principles, mechanics, and design. I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and apply my engineering skills to real-world challenges.

I enjoy the opportunity to merge creativity with technical expertise, finding innovative solutions to complex problems. Continuous learning and staying up-to-date with the latest technologies are important aspects of my professional growth.
               <br>
               Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, I love to bake cakes, engaging in activities that nurture my spiritual well-being, and participating in community service projects that allow me to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world around me.
               <br>
               I am always open to new opportunities and collaborations that align with my values and allow me to contribute my skills and expertise. If you'd like to connect, collaborate, or have any questions, feel free to reach out. I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
